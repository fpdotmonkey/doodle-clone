# Doodle Poll Clone

This is a clone of <https://doodle.com>, which is a website that helps you to
find a meeting time by allowing meeting participants vote on what times work for
them.  I'll be putting my own twist on it by tailoring it to friends or
classmates trying to find a time for a regular weekly meeting, like a game night
or project work session.

To run it, just execute `make up` and then open `localhost:4567` in your
browser.  You'll need to have ruby, bundler, and npm installed.
